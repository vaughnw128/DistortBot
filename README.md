# DistortBot
Bot used for distorting images in discord chat channels :]

# Usage

To run the bot, create a config file named `config.py` with a line in it containing your bot token in the format `token="{token}"`

When in the chat channel, pass an image to the bot to distort using the command `$distort {image}`
The image can be passed in as an image link, or as an attached image via copy/paste or file upload. GIFs somewhat work, but not entirely.
